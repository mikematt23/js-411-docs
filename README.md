# Austin Coding Academy - JS411

## Course Objective

By the end of the 411 course, students will have built a front-end app with React that uses the database and server built in JS311 to demonstrate their understanding of this technology for their graduation presentation. Coupling their back-end server with their front-end app, students will complete their full-stack web app Capstone Project.

While this course will incorporate the skills learned in 211 and 311, the main focus is for students to learn a particular library, React, for building dynamic front-end web apps. Students will use the last two weeks of this course to complete their Capstone Project app with the guidance of their instructor.
